## My Prompt

Explain to me like I'm a 5 year old, what is a JavaScript loop?

##

Hey Susan, sure thing! Think of a JavaScript loop like a little robot that can do the same thing over and over again. Imagine you have a bunch of toys, and you want the robot to pick up each toy, one by one. Instead of telling the robot to pick up each toy individually, you can tell it to pick up a toy, and then say, "Okay, do it again for the next toy" until there are no more toys left.

In web development, loops are like that robot. They help you do the same task, like checking a list of things on a website or counting from 1 to 10, without having to write the same code over and over. It's like having a helpful little assistant that follows your instructions to repeat a task until you say, "Stop." Loops are super handy for web development and coding in general, especially when you have lots of things to work with.
